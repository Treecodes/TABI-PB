# TABI-PB
TABI-PB (treecode-accelerated boundary integral) solves the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The solver employs a well-conditioned boundary integral formulation for the electrostatic potential and its normal derivative on a triangulated molecular surface, and the integral equations are discretized by nodepatch method. The linear system is solved by GMRES iteration, and the matrix-vector product is carried out by a barycentric Lagrange interpolation dual tree traversal (BLDTT) fast summation method which reduces the cost from O(N^2) to O(N), where N is the number elements. This solver also includes NVIDIA GPU support using OpenACC with the PGI/ NVIDIA HPC compilers.

This TABI-PB repo serves as a submodule to APBS, and also works as a standalone distribution. For more information on building APBS, [visit this link](https://apbs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Build Instructions

This project uses CMake to manage and configure its build system. In principle, 
building an independent `tabipb` executable is as simple as executing the following 
from the top level directory of TABI-PB:

    mkdir build; cd build; export CC=<CXX compiler>; cmake ..; make

This creates a `tabipb` executable located at `TABI-PB/build/bin/tabipb`.
Compiling the GPU version requires that a PGI/ NVIDIA HPC C++ compiler be used, 
and that `cmake` be invoked with the flag `-DENABLE_OPENACC=ON`.

`tabipb` relies on NanoShaper to triangulate the molecular surface. To get a NanoShaper
executable appropriate for your system, invoke `cmake` with the flag `-DGET_NanoShaper=ON`.

## Examples

To run an example, navigate to the examples directory, and run `tabipb` with the 
example input file:
```
cd examples/
../build/bin/tabipb usrdata.in
```
