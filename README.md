# TABI-PB
TABI-PB (treecode-accelerated boundary integral) solves the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The solver employs a well-conditioned boundary integral formulation for the electrostatic potential and its normal derivative on a triangulated molecular surface, and the integral equations are discretized by nodepatch method. The linear system is solved by GMRES iteration, and the matrix-vector product is carried out by a barycentric Lagrange interpolation dual tree traversal (BLDTT) fast summation method which reduces the cost from O(N^2) to O(N), where N is the number elements.

This solver also includes NVIDIA GPU support using OpenACC with the PGI/ NVIDIA HPC compilers.

This TABI-PB repo serves as a submodule to APBS, and also works as a standalone distribution. For more information on building APBS, [visit this repository](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-pdb2pqr/tree/master/apbs).

## Build Instructions
To build as an independent executable:
```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This creates a tabipb executable located at TABI-PB/build/bin/tabipb. To build with NVIDIA GPU support, run cmake with the flag `-DENABLE_OPENACC=ON`. 

To run an example, navigate to the examples directory, and run ../build/bin/tabipb:
```
cd examples/
../build/bin/tabipb usrdata.in
```
